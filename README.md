### Pixel 2 Experience
I made a compilation of the different mods and came up with this Pixel 2 Experience module which can be flashed with other devices on Nougat.

### Information
Searching around the internet, I've seen several mods on XDA, GitHub and other websites which have extracted files from the Pixel 2 devices. I've decided to gather them and compiled them all into a single Magisk Module. This module can be flashed with other devices on Oreo as well.

### Features
- Ruthless Pixel Launcher by @shuby (with icon pack support among other lovely features) | [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-ruthless-pixel-launcher-based-t3755903/)
- Pixel Launcher icons
- Google Wallpapers app
- Adds Pixel-exclusive wallpapers via Google Wallpapers app
- Pixel accent (in system/vendor/overlay/Pixel)
- Google Lens enabled in Google Photos
- Google Sans font used in Google Assistant, Pixel Launcher, System Update window, SetupWizard text, lockscreen clock
- Pixel 2 audio (ringtones, notifications, ui, alarms)
- Enable Google Assistant via build.prop
- Camera2 API support (find a working Modded Google Camera app [here](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/)
- Enables Night Light support

Features I can add in but don't think will work in all Oreo devices

- Pixel Navigation Bar style (might not work with most 8.0 devices due to differences between the SystemUI.apk)

### Latest changelog
