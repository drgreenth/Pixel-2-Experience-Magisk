### Pixel 2 Experience
I made a compilation of the different mods and came up with this Pixel 2 Experience module which can be flashed with other devices on Oreo.

### Information
Searching around the internet, I've seen several mods on XDA, GitHub and other websites which have extracted files from the Pixel 2 devices. I've decided to gather them and compiled them all into a single Magisk Module. This module can be flashed with other devices on Oreo as well.

### Features
- Modded Pixel 2 Launcher by @paphonb [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-rootless-pixel-2-launcher-google-t3688393/)
- Pixel Launcher icons
- Google Wallpapers app
- Adds Pixel-exclusive wallpapers via Google Wallpapers app
- Pixel system accent theme (in system/vendor/overlay/Pixel)
- Google Lens enabled in Google Photos
- Google Sans font family used in Google Assistant, Pixel Launcher, System Update window, SetupWizard text
- Pixel 2 audios (ringtones, notifications, ui, alarms)
- Enable Google Assistant via build.prop
- Camera 2 API Support added (v1.1)

The following are still being considered to be added in:

- Pixel 2 Bootanimation

Features I can add in but don't think will work in all Oreo devices:

- Automatic dark SystemUI theme depending on wallpaper (can only work in 8.1+, could possibly a different version of the module)

### Latest changelog
v1.2:
- added modded Pixel 2 Launcher by @paphonb
- added Google Wallpapers app
- added Pixel Launcher icons app

### Compatibility
- Xiaomi Mi A1

Feel free to report if it works on other devices as well. It should work on other devices as long as they are close to stock (Stock/Custom ROMs).
