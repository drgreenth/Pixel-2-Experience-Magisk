### Pixel 2 Experience
I made a compilation of the different mods and came up with this Pixel 2 Experience module which can be flashed with other devices on Oreo.

### Information
Searching around the internet, I've seen several mods on XDA, GitHub and other websites which have extracted files from the Pixel 2 devices. I've decided to gather them and compiled them all into a single Magisk Module. This module can be flashed with other devices on Oreo as well.

### Features
- Pixel system accent theme (in system/vendor/overlay/Pixel)
- Google Lens enabled in Google Photos
- Adds Pixel-exclusive wallpapers via Google Wallpapers app
- Google Sans font family used in Google Assistant, Pixel Launcher, System Update window, SetupWizard text
- Pixel 2 audios (ringtones, notifications, ui, alarms)
- Enable Google Assistant via build.prop
- Camera 2 API Support added (v1.1)

The following are still being considered to be added in:

- Modded Pixel Launcher (possibly coming soon? depends on @paphonb's response)
- Pixel Launcher Icons (from the regular GApps packages)
- Pixel 2 Bootanimation

Features I can add in but don't think will work in all Oreo devices:

- Automatic dark SystemUI theme depending on wallpaper (can only work in 8.1+, could possibly a different version of the module)

### Latest changelog
v1.1:
- added Camera2 API Support

It should work on other devices as long as they are close to stock (Stock/Custom ROMs).
