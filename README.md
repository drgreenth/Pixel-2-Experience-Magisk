### Pixel 2 Experience
I made a compilation of the different mods and came up with this Pixel 2 Experience module which can be flashed with other devices on Oreo.

### Information
So I've seen mods around the internet, XDA, GitHub and other websites which have extracted files and mods from the Pixel 2 devices and compiled into flashable ZIPs and/or Magisk Modules. I made a compilation of the different mods and came up with this Pixel 2 Experience mod for my Xiaomi Mi A1 which can be flashed with other devices on Oreo as well.

### Features
- Pixel system accent theme
- Google Lens in Google Photos
- Pixel unlimited storage upload via Google Photos
- Adds Pixel-exclusive wallpapers via Google Wallpapers app
- Google Sans font family used in Assistant, Pixel Launcher as well as system update window
- Pixel 2 audios (ringtones, notifications, ui, alarms)
- Enable Google Assistant
- Camera 2 API Support (v1.1)
- Modded Pixel Launcher (possibly coming soon?)

### Changelog
v1.1:
- added Camera2 API Support

v1.0:
- renamed module from Pixel 2 Mod to Pixel 2 Experience
- removed android.auto_generated_rro__ app from system/vendor/overlay to avoid bootloop after removing the module.
- removed SysUiDarkTheme in system/vendor/overlay as it may conflict with preinstalled versions (for 8.1+)
